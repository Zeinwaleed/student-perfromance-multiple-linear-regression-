Welcome to the Student Performance Analysis project! This repository explores the fascinating relationship between various factors and student academic performance using multiple linear regression.

## 📊 Overview

Our goal is to uncover insights that can help educators and policymakers improve student outcomes. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of student performance, we aim to identify key predictors of success.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Model Building:** Implement multiple linear regression to predict student performance.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's accuracy and performance.
- **Visualizations:** Gain insights through detailed plots and charts.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
